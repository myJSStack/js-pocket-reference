# Arrays
- Ordered elements by index number, in JS, they are dynamic.
- Array elements in JS can be different type.
### Creating Arrays
1. Array literal(almost alway simpler): `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `b = [1,,2]`, `c=[,,]` note that missing elements are `undefined`, and `trailing ,` is optioal
2. Using array constructor: `new Array()`, `new Array(10)`, `new Array(2,3, 'a')`
### Array Elements and Length
1. access is possible with bracket []
2. ***length property is writable***
