### Here is what are new in JS6

Readme material is coming from Udemy [JS6 tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-es6-tutorial)

- Array helper functions
    - `forEach`: used to look through the array. 
    - `map`: Generate a new mapped array. Arrays are immutable, but by using this helper function, we will have one good final mapped array. Highly useful in FE web development.
    - `filter`: if internal function gives `true`, we will see it in the filtered array.
    - `find`
    - `every`: all elements in array follow the same rule.
    - `some`: some of the elements in array follow the same rule.
    - `reduce`: internal function takes initial value and element.
- const/let: we are no longer using damn `var`
