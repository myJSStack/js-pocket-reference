### Here is what are new in JS6

Readme material is coming from Udemy [JS6 tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-es6-tutorial)

- Array helper functions
    - `forEach`: used to look through the array. 
    - `map`: Generate a new mapped array. Arrays are immutable, but by using this helper function, we will have one good final mapped array. Highly useful in FE web development.
    - `filter`: if internal function gives `true`, we will see it in the filtered array.
    - `find`
    - `every`: all elements in array follow the same rule.
    - `some`: some of the elements in array follow the same rule.
    - `reduce`: internal function takes initial value and element.
- const/let: we are no longer using damn `var`(mother fucker trouble maker)
- Template strings: back ticks with `${}` where js variables go into this `${}`: just look how it makes it easy to make string of JSON!
- Arrow function (Lamda function in Java,C#, etc): 
    - (a,b) => {x,Y,z, return ali;}
    - Implicit return (because a single expression): a => a + b 
        - For compact syntax "single argument is needed for the part one. and sinlge expression is needed for the part two.
        - Compact syntax may make it confusing, do not sit on it.
    

    
[Personal] left over practices in the training
- Implementing `Pluck`
- Implementing `Reject`
- Implementing `findWhere`
- Implementing `Unique`
- Review the `when to use arrow functions continue`: very valuable materials
