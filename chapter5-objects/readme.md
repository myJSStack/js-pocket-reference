# Objects
- An object is an unordered collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value. Property names are strings, so we can say that objects map strings to values.
- This string-to-value mapping goes by various names: `hash`, `hashtable`, `dictionary`, `associative array`.
- In addition to maintaining its own set of properties, a JavaScript object also inherits the properties of another object, known as its “prototype.” 
- **Any value in JavaScript that is not a string, a number, true, false, null, or undefined is an object.**
- Objects are **mutable** and are manipulated **by reference** rather than by value
